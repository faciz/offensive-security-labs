# Lab 01: Compromised VM

## Scenario

You are Mr.Ton, first name Plank, and you aspire to create a popular fast food restaurant. You found the public ip for a machine in your  rival's restaurant. Try to gain access to their company secret!

## Setup Lab

You should first go through the `Lab 01` section in the presentation. After doing so, run the `lab_01_setup` script, but try not to read the script until after completing the lab so you don't ruin the *magic*.

```bash
cd Lab_01_Compromised_VM
./lab01_setup.sh
```

### Hard Mode

Go find the secret. Hopefully the powerpoint taught you something. Good luck.

### Guided Mode

Follow these [instructions](./Lab%2001:%20Compromised%20VM/guided_mode.md).
