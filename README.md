# Overview

"Be The Hacker" is a series of hands-on labs designed to provide you with insight into how an attacker could exploit improperly secured environments. 

Through a series of scenarios, this lab series aims to teach the common mistakes made during cloud resource setup and software configuration, and demonstrate how they can be exploited by a bad actor.

By simulating real-world attacks on vulnerable systems, you'll gain practical experience in securing your own infrastructure and applications, and understand the importance of strong security practices.

# Prerequisites

## Presentation

Before starting these labs, please go through the accompanying PowerPoint [presentation](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/p/zackaryafaci/ER5zu7QBPrVHvP54ScLMhGoB-tS4THMKDzGJn1-FT_g0uA?e=0ujWl0). It provides essential context and information that will be helpful as you work through the labs.

Refer back to the presentation as needed while completing the labs.

## Setup

Before starting these labs, please ensure you have the following:

- **Linux/Unix Environment**: These labs are designed to run on Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The setup scripts and labs use bash and Unix tools.

- **Azure Subscription**: These labs will create resources in your Azure subscription. Make sure you have an active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.

- **Azure CLI Authentication**: You'll need to authenticate with Azure using the following commands:
  ```bash
  az login
  ```
  If not prompted to select a subscription, you may need to set the desired subscription using:
  ```bash
    az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
    ```

- **Script Dependencies**: Install the required tools for lab setup scripts:
  - **coreutils**:
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install coreutils`
    - CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install coreutils`
    - macOS: `brew install coreutils`
  - **sshpass**:
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install sshpass`
    - CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install sshpass`
    - macOS: `brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass`

# Lab 01: Compromised VM

## Scenario

You are Mr.Ton, first name Plank, and you aspire to create a popular fast food restaurant. You found the public ip for a machine in your  rival's restaurant. Try to gain access to their company secret!

## Setup Lab

You should first go through the `Lab 01` section in the presentation. After doing so, run the `lab01_setup.sh` script. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
The setup script is encoded to retain the challenge of the lab. You should not see how the resources are created.
>
>Do not look at the resources created in the Azure portal until **AFTER** you have completed the lab, as it may spoil the challenge.
>
>If you are curious, you may decode/read the setup script **AFTER** completing the lab.

```bash
cd Lab_01_Compromised_VM
./lab01_setup.sh
```

## Completing the Lab:

### Option 1: Hard Mode (Recommended)

Go find the secret. Hopefully the powerpoint taught you something. Good luck.

### Option 2: Guided Mode 

It is recommended to try the hard mode first, but if you get stuck, you can use the guide to help you through the steps.

The full step-by-step guide is available [here](./Lab_01_Compromised_VM/guided_mode.md).
