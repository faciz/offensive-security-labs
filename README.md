# Overview

"Be The Hacker" is a series of hands-on labs designed to provide you with insight into how an attacker could exploit improperly secured environments. 

Through a series of scenarios, this lab series aims to teach the common mistakes made during cloud resource setup and demonstrate how they can be exploited by a bad actor.

By simulating real-world attacks on vulnerable systems, you'll gain practical experience in securing your own cloud infrastructure and understanding the importance of strong security practices.

# Lab 01: Compromised VM

## Scenario

You are Mr.Ton, first name Plank, and you aspire to create a popular fast food restaurant. You found the public ip for a machine in your  rival's restaurant. Try to gain access to their company secret!

## Setup Lab

You should first go through the `Lab 01` section in the presentation. After doing so, run the `lab_01_setup` script, but try not to read the script until after completing the lab so you don't ruin the *magic*.

```bash
cd Lab_01_Compromised_VM
./lab01_setup.sh
```

### Hard Mode
